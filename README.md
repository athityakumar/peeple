# Peeple

Peep and know about people

This code repository is mainly split into 2 parts - `api` and `client`. `api` handles everything backend, and `client` handles everything frontend.

### Use case

A quick recap of Black Mirror S03E01 "NoseDive". Let's say you're at a hackathon/conference filled with people you'd love to network with; but don't have time to interact with everyone on a 1:1 basis. What if getting in touch with people was easy as taking a photo?

Peeple will peep into a database of registered users, and show the name & social media profiles of people present in the photo - so that you can network with them later.
